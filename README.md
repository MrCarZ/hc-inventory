# Inventory System App
Very simple Inventory System developed as a challenge for the Hiring Coders Bootcamp.

The idea was to implement a Inventory that could save information about clients and items with the following requirements:

* Data persistence;  
* Possibility to create and delete data; 
* Save Data at browser's LocalStorage

It was an application developed using only HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascript, and some custom styles from the internet.
